# Simon Says Game - Additional Features Creation Guide

In this guide, you'll learn how to add exciting new features to your Simon Says game. Each feature will enhance your game and provide an opportunity to expand your programming skills.

## Feature 1: Countdown Timer

**Purpose:** Add a countdown timer for each level to increase the challenge.

### Implementation:

1. **HTML:**

- Create an HTML element to display the timer.
  ```HTML
  <div id="timer">10</div>
  ```

2. **JavaScript:**

- Initialize a timer variable (e.g., `var countdown = 10;`) to set the initial time.
- Use setInterval to decrease the timer value every second.
- Update the timer element's content with the remaining time.

```javascript
// Update the timer element's content
function updateTimer() {
  $("#timer").text(countdown);
}

// Start the countdown timer
var timerInterval = setInterval(function () {
  countdown--;
  updateTimer();

  // Check if time is up
  if (countdown === 0) {
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    // Implement game over logic here
  }
}, 1000);
```

## Feature 2: Difficulty Levels

**Purpose:** Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that affect the game's speed or pattern complexity.

### Implementation:

1. **HTML:**

- Create a difficulty selection menu (e.g., radio buttons or a dropdown).

```HTML
<select id="difficulty">
    <option value="easy">Easy</option>
    <option value="medium">Medium</option>
    <option value="hard">Hard</option>
</select>
```

2. **JavaScript:**

- Adjust game variables (e.g., sequence speed, pattern length) based on the selected difficulty level.
- Listen for changes in the difficulty selection.

```javascript
// Get the selected difficulty level
var selectedDifficulty = $("#difficulty").val();

// Adjust game settings based on the selected difficulty
if (selectedDifficulty === "easy") {
  // Modify game settings for easy mode
} else if (selectedDifficulty === "medium") {
  // Modify game settings for medium mode
} else if (selectedDifficulty === "hard") {
  // Modify game settings for hard mode
}

// Listen for changes in difficulty selection
$("#difficulty").change(function () {
  selectedDifficulty = $(this).val();
  // Adjust game settings when the difficulty changes
});
```
