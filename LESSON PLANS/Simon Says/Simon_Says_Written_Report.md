# Simon Says Game Report

### Introduction

Hey there! Have you ever played "Simon Says"? It's a really fun game on the computer where you have to remember and follow a pattern of lights and sounds. It's like a memory test but way more exciting. Let me tell you all about it!

### How the Game Looks

Imagine you're looking at a screen with four big buttons, each one a different bright color - green, red, yellow, and blue. When you start playing, these buttons light up one by one and make neat sounds. There's also a big title at the top of the screen that tells you what level you're on. It's like playing with a colorful, musical light show!

### Playing the Game

To start the game, you just press any key on your keyboard. Then, one of the buttons lights up and makes a sound. Your job is to remember which button it was and click it with your mouse. As you get it right, the game shows you another button, adding it to the sequence. You need to remember and click the buttons in the same order they lit up. Each level adds one more button to remember!

### What Happens When You Play

Every time you get the sequence right, the game congratulates you with a "SUCCESS!!" message and moves you to the next level, where it gets a bit harder. But if you click the wrong button, the screen flashes red, and it says "Game Over." But don't worry! You can always start again by pressing a key.

### Cool Features

The buttons in Simon Says don't just light up; they also make different sounds when they do, making the game more exciting. When you click a button, it looks like it's being pressed down, adding to the fun.

### Why It's Fun

Simon Says isn't just about clicking colored buttons. It's a great way to test how good your memory is and see how many levels you can complete. You can even challenge your friends or family to see who can remember the most!

### Conclusion

So, the Simon Says game is an awesome way to play with colors and sounds on your computer. It's not just entertaining but also a cool way to exercise your brain. Try it out and see how far you can get!
