# Simon Says Game Report

### Introduction

Hey there! Have you ever played a fun memory game where you need to remember colors and sounds? That's what the Simon game is all about! It's a cool game on the computer where you see colorful buttons and try to remember the order they light up. Let me tell you all about it!

### How the Game Looks

Imagine a square with four big buttons, each a different color - green, red, yellow, and blue. When you start the game, these buttons light up and make sounds, one at a time. There's also a big title at the top that tells you which level you're on. It's like a colorful light show!

### Playing the Game

When you start the game by pressing any key on your keyboard, one of the buttons will light up and make a sound. Your job is to click on that same button. Then, the game shows you another button, and you have to remember the first button and click the new one too. Each time, the game adds one more button to the sequence, and you have to remember the whole pattern in order.

### What Happens When You Play

Each time you click the right buttons in the correct order, the game tells you "SUCCESS!!" and takes you to the next level, where it gets a little harder. But, if you press the wrong button, the screen turns red, and it says "Game Over." Don't worry, though! You can always start over by pressing a key again.

### Cool Features

The buttons don't just light up; they also make different sounds when they light up, which makes the game more fun. Plus, when you click on a button, it looks like it's being pressed down, so it feels like you're really playing!

### Why It's Fun

This game is not just about clicking buttons. It's a super way to test your memory and see how many levels you can pass. You can challenge your friends or family to see who remembers the longest sequence.

### Conclusion

So, the Simon game is a really exciting way to play with colors and sounds on your computer, and it helps you get better at remembering things. It's like a brain exercise that feels like a fun game. Give it a try, and see how far you can go!
