# Simon Says Game JavaScript Code Walkthrough

In this walkthrough, we will explore the JavaScript code (`game.js`) that powers the Simon Says game. This code handles game logic, user interactions, and more.

## Variable Declarations

```javascript
// Array of button colors
var buttonColours = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"];

// Stores the sequence generated by the game
var gamePattern = [];

// Stores the user's clicked pattern
var userClickedPattern = [];

// Tracks if the game has started
var started = false;

// Current level of the game
var level = 0;
```
