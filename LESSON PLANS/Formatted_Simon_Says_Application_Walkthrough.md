# Application Walkthrough: Creating a Simon Says Game

### Step 1: Project Setup

- 1.1. Create a new folder for your project, and give it a descriptive name like "SimonSaysGame."

- 1.2. Inside the project folder, create the following files: index.html, styles.css, game.js.

- 1.3. Download any necessary sound files (e.g., red.mp3, blue.mp3, etc.) and place them in a folder named "sounds" within your project directory.

### Step 2: HTML Structure

- 2.1. Open index.html in your code editor.

- 2.2. Create the basic HTML structure by adding the following elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <title>Simon Says</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

</head>

<body>

    <!-- Add game elements here -->

    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-/JqT3SQfawRcv/BIHPThkBvs0OEvtFFmqPF/lYI/Cxo=" crossorigin="anonymous" defer></script>

    <script src="game.js" defer></script>

</body>

</html>

### Step 3: CSS Styling

- 3.1. Open styles.css in your code editor.

- 3.2. Define the basic styling for the game elements, including the game board, buttons, and any customizations you desire. Use CSS classes to select and style the elements.

### Step 4: JavaScript Logic

- 4.1. Open game.js in your code editor.

- 4.2. Define and initialize variables for the game, such as buttonColours, gamePattern, userClickedPattern, started, and level.

- 4.3. Create a function, nextSequence(), to generate a random color pattern for Simon and display it to the user. Use Math.random() and jQuery animations for this.

- 4.4. Implement event listeners to handle user input when buttons are clicked. When a button is clicked, play the corresponding sound and add the color to the userClickedPattern array.

- 4.5. Create a function, checkAnswer(currentLevel), to compare the user's pattern to Simon's pattern. Check if the user got the sequence right and proceed to the next level if they did. If the user makes a mistake, trigger the game over scenario.

- 4.6. Implement functions for playing sounds, animating button presses, and restarting the game.

- 4.7. Add a keypress event listener to start the game when a key is pressed.

### Step 5: Debugging and Testing

- 5.1. Use console.log() statements strategically to debug your code. Print important variables and values to the console to identify issues.

- 5.2. Test the game at various stages of development. Verify that button clicks, animations, and sounds work as expected.

### Step 6: Customization (Optional)

- 6.1. Allow customization of game elements such as colors, fonts, and sounds by modifying the CSS and adding more sound files to the "sounds" folder.

### Step 7: Final Touches and Optimization

- 7.1. Optimize the game for performance, ensuring smooth animations and responsiveness on different devices.

- 7.2. Add any final touches, such as transitions between levels or feedback for the player.

### Step 8: Conclusion and Next Steps

- 8.1. Recap what you've accomplished in the project.

- 8.2. Encourage further exploration of web development, JavaScript, and game development.

### Step 9: Homework Assignment (Optional)

- 9.1. Assign additional features or challenges to students for further practice and creativity.

### Step 10: Assessment (Optional)

- 10.1. Assess students' understanding of the project through a review of their customized games or a quiz.

### Step 11: Q&A and Assistance (Ongoing)

- 11.1. Be available to answer students' questions and provide assistance as they work on their projects.

### Step 12: Follow-up Sessions (Optional)

- 12.1. Consider scheduling follow-up sessions to review homework assignments, address challenges, and showcase students' projects.
