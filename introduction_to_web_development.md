## Adding Content

- Let's start by creating a simple page that contains the phrase "Hello, World!" in the body. The page will also have a title - that thing that shows up in the title of the tab in your browser. The **`<title>`** element defines the title of the HTML page.
- The **`<p>`** element defines a "paragraph", a block of text that has a small amount of spacing in between its top and bottom.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <title>Content Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is an example of a simple HTML page with one paragraph.</p>
